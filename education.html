			üåü "I had the sweetest two years at <a href="https://www.kemas.gov.my/kemas-kedah/"> Tabika Kemas Pekan Jitra,</a> in 06000 Jitra, Kedah, from 2009 to 2010. <br>
			It was a magical place where every day was an adventure. I loved playing with colorful toys, singing <br>
			cheerful songs, and making crafts with glue and glitter that would end up everywhere! Storytime was <br>
			always my favorite, especially when the teacher used funny voices for the characters. During outdoor play, <br>
			we ran around the playground, laughing and chasing each other, while snack time felt like a mini feast with <br>
			my friends. I even remember learning my ABCs and numbers through fun games that made learning exciting. <br>
			Those two years were filled with laughter, love, and so many precious memories that will always hold a special <br>
			place in my heart." üè´‚ú®
